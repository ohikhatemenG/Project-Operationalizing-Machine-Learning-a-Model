I started with Authentication and then run Auto ML Model or experiement to get the best model and after that I Deploy the Best Model. The next action I took was to applied the Enable Logging(Enable Application Insight) to reveiw important information about the service when consuming the Consume Model Endpoints. The next steps was to Create AND Publish, and interact with a pipeline, finally established a Documentation for the people to read and learn.
